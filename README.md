# StartUpEcoSystem
The project “StartUp EcoSystem” is a web application developed for managing the entire department and performs the operations in the organization. This Application provides an effective and easily understandable medium for organization and the entrepreneurs to run the system and manage the work properly.

# OBJECTIVE:-
The objective of this project is to develop a “StartUp EcoSystem” that will manage all the departments like Admin, HR, Sales and Finance etc. of the StartUp EcoSystem in a single system. 

# TOOLS USED :-

 1)Eclipse:
Eclipse is a multi-language software development environment comprising an integrated development environment (IDE) and an extensible plug-in system. It can be used to develop applications in Java and, by means of various plug-ins, other programming languages like c, c++, android etc.
Following are the main features of Eclipse: 
i. It is an open source.
ii. It is strongly recommended by Android developer.
iii. It is directly linked with compiler, so we don’t need to compile the program
iv. It has good UI (user interface).

 2)Rational Rose:
Rational Rose is an object-oriented Unified Modeling Language (UML) software design tool intended for visual modeling and component construction of enterprise-level software applications. Software designer uses Rational Rose to visually create (model) the framework for an application by blocking out classes with actors (stick figures), use case elements (ovals), objects (rectangles) and messages/relationships (arrows) in a sequence diagram using drag-and-drop symbols. Rational Rose documents the diagram as it is being constructed and then generates code in the designer's choice of C++, Android, iOS, Java, or Data Definition Language.

 3)MySQL:
MySQL is an open source relational database management system. It is a popular choice of database for use in Web Application and is a central component of the widely used open source Web Application software stack. MySQL server software itself and the client libraries used dual-licensing distribution.
Other kinds of data stores can be used, such as files on the file system or large hash tables in memory but data fetching and writing would not be so fast and easy with those type of system.
Following are the main features of MySQL: 
i. MySQL is released under an open source license. So you have nothing to pay to use it.
ii. MySQL is a powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.
iii. MySQL uses a standard form of the well known sql data language.
iv. MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets.

# FEASIBILITY STUDY:-

After requirements clarification, analysis proposes some solutions. After this it is checked whether it is practically possible to implement that solution or not. This is done through feasibility study. Feasibility study must be there before the development of any project to ensure that the system is technically feasible, economically feasible and operationally feasible. In this various feasibility aspects are analyzed depending on the context of the system. The outcome of the feasibility study should be very clear.


 1 Technical Feasibility

The technical feasibility assessment is focused on gaining an understanding of the present technical resources of the organization and their applicability to the expected needs of the proposed system. It is an evaluation of the hardware and software and how it meets the need of the proposed system.

So after being ensured we can say yes the project is technically feasible because in development of StartUp EcoSystem project concepts of Java Core and Advanced, Java Script, Html, Bootstrap, Jquery and MySQL are used. Objective of java has been implemented through SERVLET and JSP, and it needs the base of Eclipse. To run the Eclipse a window system is needed hence the required hardware and software environment has to be provided for the development of the project.






 2 Operational Feasibility

Operational feasibility shows that the system is operationally implementable. While finding operational feasibility of a system following queries are answered by software engineer; if the system is developed, will it be used. Includes people-oriented and social issues like internal issues, such as manpower problems, labor objections, manager resistance, 13 organizational conflicts and policies also external issues, including social acceptability, legal aspects and government regulations.

After all study, the project implemented is operationally feasible because in this project the operations designed are simple, easy to understand and there is no external and internal issues occurred. It includes the basic functionality, such as recruits the employees, financials operation, client project manages, etc. all are in this project.


 3 Economic Feasibility

Economic feasibility is the compulsory part of the feasibility study in which we find out the cost of development, resources (including men, machine and money) required during development of the project. And ensure that the project will be beneficial for both the parties i.e. software engineer and user.

The cost of hardware and software required and resources such as technology, tools and equipments required for this project. In development of the project, the development cost is very less, and it can be completed within less resources. The software developed is scalable in the future, this software can be customized as per the client requirements and can serve different business. 

# Functional Requirements :-
	
Functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do. It defines the function of a system and its components. A function is described as a set of input, the behavior, and output.

The application must provide following functionalities:

i. The application should provide admin login to authenticate the admin.
ii. Admin must manage the entire department, show details and given task.
iii. The entire department performs their related task.

 1 Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are requirements which specify criteria that can be saved to judge the operation of an application, rather than specific behaviors. This should be contrasted with functional requirements that specify specific behavior of functions. Typical non-functional requirements are reliability, scalability, and cost-effective.

Non-functional requirements are often called the militias of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are “constraints”, “quality attributes”, and “quality of service requirements”.

i. Security: Application security.

ii. Multi language support: Required

iii. Performance: Best Possible

# Team Organization :-

There are almost many human organizational structures for software development as there is an organization that develops software. Their best team structure depends on the management style, of an organization. The number of people who populate the team and the overall problem difficulty are as follows:


i. Democratic Decentralized (DD)
        In our project we are using Democratic Decentralized (DD) team. This software team has no permanent leader. Rather “task coordinators are appointed for short durations and then replaced by others who may coordinate different task.” Decisions on problems approaches are made by group Conesus. Communication among team member is horizontal.


ii. Controlled Decentralized (CD)
       This software engineering team has defined leader who coordinate specific task and secondary leaders that have responsibility for the sub-tasks. Problem solving remains a group activity, but implementation of solutions is partitioned among subgroups by team leader. Communication among subgroups may be vertical or horizontal.

iii. Controlled Centralized (CC)
       Top level problem solving and internal team coordination are managed by a team leader. Communication between the team leaders and the team members is vertical.

Thus our software team is democratic and decentralized as there is no leader all of give the innovative idea and the best is chosen to be implemented. Decision is a group activity, and both being an integral part of it. Communication among the team is horizontal. The DD team structure is applied to problem with relatively lower modularity. The DD team structure permits generation of free ideas hence leads to innovation and helps in countering complex problem. 

# Resource Planning :-

The hardware and software requirements for the project while developing are as follows:

i. Hardware Requirements

Processor			      	2.56 GHz - i3 with quad cores
RAM				            3 GB
Memory				        170 GB

ii. Software Requirements
Operating System			Microsoft windows
Platform				      Java
IDE				            Eclipse


# Interface Design :-

User interface design, sometimes also called user interface engineering, is the design of software applications and websites with the focus on the user’s experience and interaction.

Unlike traditional design where the goal is to make the object or application physically attractive, the goal of user interface design is to make the user interaction experience as simple and intuitive as possible what is often called user-centered design. User interface design is often fine and invisible. To design interfaces of this application is used.

There are 5 main interfaces in the proposed system named as follows:

i. Admin: It is the first Interface of the application. Working of admin is to manage all the departments, show the entire task to perform in the organization, assign a task to the employees and view balance Sheet.

ii. HR: In the organization, the main role of HR is to Recruit an employees and to generate id and which he belongs to which department. Manage all the agreements and policies. 

iii. Sales: It is to manage all the projects, client’s details and manage the records of client projects.

iv. Finance: Finance is the most important department in all the organization. All the records related to their business economy, Shares, Investment and Expenses. All the resources of incomes are store in the database and to generate the balance sheet.

v. Employee: Employee is to perform the given task, apply for their needs and leaves and submit the worksheets. 

# Coding :-

Coding is the phase of a software development project where developer's actually input the source code into a computer that will be compiled into the final software Program. Source code is the high level language that is typed into an IDE (interactive development environment) and stored in a text file on the computer. This text file is compiled into machine code, which are the instructions actually understood by the computer. The main classes used to implement the proposed system are as follows:
i. Admin: Admin class is to show the home page of Admin. All tasks are managed and view information like show the employee information as well as check leave status.
ii. HR: HR recruits the employees and manages the salary of each employee.
iii. Login: If login id and password are valid then open to the home.  
iv.        Portfolio: After login, each and every employee must complete the profile.
iv. Save: All the transaction and information are stored in the database.
v. Update: If employee wants to edit our information then they do it. 
vi. Delete: Admin delete any information.
vii. Balance Sheet: Balance sheet may generate on the basis of business transaction.
ix.        Sales: Sales Manager is to manage the client and their project related information. 
x. Finance: Finance Manager is to manage all the transaction related to business.
xi. Employee: Employee is to perform the given work.
xii. Add Expense: Business expense is stored in the database.
xiii. Add Income: Business income is stored in the database.
xiv. Add Investment: Business investment is stored in the database.
xv. Show: All the information related to employee, balance sheet, projects, clients by admin.


 # CONCLUSION :-

The main aim of this project is to manage the entire departments within the organization. With the help of the application, organization can easily view their balance sheet, records of employee etc. This project is based on java web application. It is accessible within the organization. In the design phase, the requirements gathered from analysis phase are utilized and modules are designed. Various UML diagrams are also developed which enable user to better understand the systems flow and its components. Then in implementation phase code corresponding to all the modules is generated and is tested in the testing phase. 



# LIMITATIONS :-

The only limitation of this project is it can be used for in house use, instead on execute on live server, project run on local server for security reasons.

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENT :-
Currently project developed for common requirement which companies needed to maintain for proper operation flow. There are much functionality can be added for scope like:
a) The finance module of the project can be improved, so that it will work as internal accounting software for all accounts management.
b) The salary management module can be enhanced. In such a way so that automatic on click employees salary will process and instant salary slip will generate.
c) Notification and chat is useful for employee to communicate.
